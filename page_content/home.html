<h1>HUSACCT project</h1>
<p>HUSACCT provides support for software architecture compliance checking (SACC) of Java and C# systems.
SACC monitors the conformance of the implemented architecture (in the source code) to the intended software architecture (in the system's design).<br> 
The prominent feature of HUSACCT is the support of semantically rich modular architectures (SRMAs), which are composed of modules of different types (like software subsystems, layers and components) and rules of different types.
To perform an SACC, an intended software architecture is defined first. Next, HUSACCT checks the compliance to these rules, based on static analysis of the source code, and it reports infringements.<br>
Apart from ACC-support, HUSACCT provides support for architecture reconstruction as well: the static structure of the software may be visualized, browsed, and reported.</p>

<h2>HUSACCT & HU University of Applied Sciences</h2>
<p>HUSACCT means: HU Software Architecture Compliance Checking Tool, where HU stands for: <a href="http://international.hu.nl/" title="HU" target="_blank">HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht</a>.
The HUSACCT project is conducted at the Institute for ICT, located in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Students of the specialization "Advanced Software Architecture" have participated actively in the project.</p>
