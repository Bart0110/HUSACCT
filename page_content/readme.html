<p>When building new software, software architects design an architecture for the application. The programmers are tasked with realizing the application based on the designed architecture.</p>

<p>To see if the realized architecture really is the same as the designed architecture we can use the SACC-tool. To use such a SACC-tool, the following steps are to be taken.</p>

<h3>
<a name="analyse-an-architecture" class="anchor" href="#analyse-an-architecture"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analyse an architecture</h3>

<p>By analyzing an application, we are able to break down the structure of the given software. By doing this the program detects the physical entities inside the software and defines the architecture used within the application.<br>
It also allows the architects and the software engineers to get a graphical representation of the detected software architecture. Next to the possibility of getting a detailed graphical overview of the analyzed software, there is the ability to check the analyzed software architecture with an architectural model.</p>

<h3>
<a name="define-an-architecture" class="anchor" href="#define-an-architecture"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Define an architecture</h3>

<p>Within the tool we define an architecture and the rules that apply to the analyzed application's architecture. We create logical modules such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_layers_in_an_information_system_logical_architecture">Layers</a> and define rules that should be followed. The communication rules present in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC pattern</a> could be seen as an example to such rules.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>Logical Layer 'Presentation' is allowed to use Logical Layer 'Task',</code><br><code>but not with Logical Layer 'Infrastructure'.</code><br>
</li>
<li>
<code>Package 'database' is not allowed to use package 'gui'</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>Class 'MySQLDatbaseImpl' is not allowed to use class 'UserRegistrationController'</code>.<br>
</li>
</ol><p><em>(not actual syntax/code used in the tool)</em>  </p>

<h3>
<a name="mapping-the-defined-architecture" class="anchor" href="#mapping-the-defined-architecture"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mapping the defined architecture</h3>

<p>We then map the physical entities we found, to the defined logical modules. This way the tool knows which physical entities (such as namespaces, packages, classes, interfaces, etc.) are included in logical modules.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Package 'gui' should be present in Logical Layer 'Presentation'.</code></li>
<li><code>Package 'database.mysql' should be present in Logical Layer 'Infrastructure'.</code></li>
<li><code>Class 'UserRegistrationController' should be present in Logical Layer 'Presentation'.</code></li>
</ol><p><em>(not actual syntax/code used in the tool)</em>  </p>

<a name="executing-a-conformance-check" class="anchor" href="#executing-a-conformance-check"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Executing a conformance check</h3>

<p>By executing a conformance check we can see if any of the specified rules are broken. A SACC-Tool automates the process of checking whether or not these rules are broken. The reports from the conformance checks will list/graphically display the violations that occur between entities.</p>

<p>Using the results from this conformance check software-engineers and architects can evaluate their realized software architecture. If any serious issues pops up they can improve the program in such a way, it doesn't violate any rules anymore and into the program the architects meant it to be</p>

<p>After conducting research into other SACC-tools we found out that the tools aren't always as user friendly and accurate as we had expected them to be. We were then assigned to create our own SACC-tool and improve on some concepts we found lacking in others. </p>

<p>The application we were instructed to build is meant to be a contribution to the field of Software Architecture analysis and evaluation.</p>

<h2>
<a name="support" class="anchor" href="#support"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support</h2>

<p>The tool itself is written in Java.<br>
Currently there is (only) support for the following <strong>languages</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java <em>(Using Antlr)</em>
</li>
<li>.NET C# <em>(Using Antlr)</em>
</li>
</ul><p>We are trying to build support for the following <strong>rule types</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unique responsibility</li>
<li>Visibility convention</li>
<li>Naming convention</li>
<li>Subclass convention</li>
<li>Interface convention</li>
<li>Is allowed to use

<ul>
<li>Is only allowed to use</li>
<li>Is the only module allowed to use</li>
<li>Must use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is not allowed to

<ul>
<li>use modules in a higher layer</li>
<li>use modules in a not directly lower layer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exceptions to all those rules</li>
</ul><p>Also we will try to support the following <strong>violation types</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Invocation of a Method</li>
<li>Invocation of a Constructor</li>
<li>Access to a property or field</li>
<li>Extending a concrete class</li>
<li>Extending a abstract class</li>
<li>Implementing a interface</li>
<li>Declaration</li>
<li>Annotation</li>
<li>Import</li>
<li>Exception</li>
</ul><p>The architecture should allow for expansions to support more languages and rule types.</p>

<h2>
<a name="testing" class="anchor" href="#testing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>

<p>There are JUnit tests available in this repository, but we also manually test this application.<br>
For testing we use the <a href="https://github.com/HUSACCT/HUSACCT-BenchmarkApplication">Java benchmark</a> application, the <a href="https://github.com/HUSACCT/HUSACCT-CsharpBenchmarkApplication">C# benchmark</a> application, the <a href="https://github.com/HUSACCT/HUSACCT-RecognitionTest">Recognition test repository</a> and this project itself.</p>

<a name="build-team" class="anchor" href="#build-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build team</h2>

<p>This project involves six teams from one class (Bachelor Computer Science Informatics 2011-2012 and 2012-2013); around 4 to 5 people a team. Each team is responsible for a different service (control, analyze (Java and .NET), define, validate and architecture graphics).</p>
